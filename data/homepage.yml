  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I am a passionate software developer because of the mental challenges that the digital world brigs with it.
    Programming it is like a puzzle that you have to solve by finding the pieces either inside you, within your mind or outside your knowledge, and putting them together to create the solution.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My area of focus lies in building web products. I enjoy designing and coding the UI as much as
    talking with users to iterate and improve the experiences that reach business goals.
